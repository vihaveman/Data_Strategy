# Data_Strategy
 
In this project, I used MOCKED data from https://www.mockaroo.com/  and data from Columbia Sportswear’s Annual Report. I intended to understand if these data were accurate and how the analytics result impacted strategy. 


After downloading the data, I cleaned it in Python and uploaded it to MongoDB, which I used to route the FLASK App for the Production Dashboard. I also used Tableau to visualize the data. The Tableau analysis is locted here: https://public.tableau.com/authoring/Columbia_DataStrategy/Presentation#2


## Analysis 

This analysis aims to analyze production, sales, employee satisfaction, and material payments for Columbia Sportswear and link those findings to their strategic objective of maximizing profits through innovation, cost reduction and employee happiness and growth. 
  
  
My analysis found that of Columbia’s four major product areas of accessories and equipment, sportswear, footwear and outerwear, they are over-producing in accessories and equipment and under-producing in the other three areas. This under-production leaves profit on the table! Employees are relatively happy, with the production staff being the least happy.   
  
  
I recommend that Columbia democratize data so that all departments are aligned. Additionally, they should implement tactical plans such as better workforce management, inventory planning and market analysis. 

## Conclusion

As highlighted in the analysis, there are production and demand gaps; I recommend democratizing analytics insights, allowing different departments to work harmoniously. It will enable line managers to make decisions that affect the system instead of just their department. 
  
In the interim, I recommend investigating why the cost per unit increases with volume production. I believe the production facility is understaffed, paying overtime to get large production out of the door. Further analysis is needed to confirm this theory. 
  

Based on the production and sales relationship, there is room for growth as the market demand is present.
